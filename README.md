## Challenges
* Originally, I wanted to trigger the "Facts" based on Drag and Drop UI but I couldn't get it to work so instead, I wrote a "toggle" function.
## Future Improvements
* I really want to get "Drag and Drop" working.
* Add authentication functionality so that only logged in users can add, edit and delete tips.
